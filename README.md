# Weather Dashboard
This application lets user find a weather forecast for a current day and four more days by entering a city name. If several cities exist with the same name, a dropdown menu for choosing a city among a list of cities with the same name, but different states, or countries appears. City search results can be saved or cleared as needed. The app displays maximum and minimum temperatures for the day, along with  the wind speed, the humidity level, the UV index, and an icon showing how sunny or cloudy the day is forecasted to be.

## Purpose
While working on this project I learned to create API keys, make serevr-side API calls, find and use the data needed for displaying in the app using Javascript and jQuery. 

## Website
[Weather Dashboard](https://serebr-nina.github.io/weather-dashboard/)

## Contribution
I used one of weather apps that I found on the GitHub website (https://jjcourtney.github.io/weather-dashboard/) as a base code. I greatly improved it's functionality while leaving CSS styles mostly unchanged besides making it more responsive for smaller screen sizes, changing colors and font.
